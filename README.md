Hi there!
I have extensive experience (more than 10 years) in the implementation of projects for the manufacture and supply of automation systems, the implementation of complex projects, etc ..
I understand the design and technical documentation, read drawings, diagrams, understand the principles of construction of various equipment (electrical, mechanical, hydraulic units, automated process control systems).
There is an understanding of the stages and development of project documentation.
I have experience in creating sites on WordPress and OpenCart.
I am currently learning the Python programming language, as well as HTML, CSS, JS.
My English is not at the highest level yet, so sorry for the mistakes.
Good luck!
